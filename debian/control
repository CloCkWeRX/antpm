Description: ANT+minus implements the ANT/ANT+/ANT-FS protocols and provides tools.
 Userspace implementation of a wire protocol similar to the ANT/ANT+/ANT-FS protocols. The
 goal is to be able to communicate with the Forerunner 310XT watch in order to retrieve
 sports tracks. The c++ implementation is currently available under both linux and win.
 Communication with watches other than the 310XT might work, but are untested. Please report
 your experience to help improving the software.
